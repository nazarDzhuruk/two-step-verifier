The app implements a simple two-step verification process. It randomly generates a four-digit number and automatically sends it to the user's email. Each user account has a status and it is set to false by default. After a successful check, it is set to true. Before running the application, specify your gmail account (email address and password) with which messages will be sent in the application.yml file.
